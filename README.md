# Grid-Batch-Scheduling
A java implementation of batch scheduling in grid environment.
This problem is solved with `MinMin`, `MaxMin`, `Suffrage`, and `Genetic` algorithm. In this project, we want to assign tasks to machines and our purpose is minimizing makespan.

Before running the algorithm, you should set the directory of `input data` (braun dataset) in the main(), number of resources (`nres`), and number of tasks (`ntask`) based on the selected input data. 

default values:
```
inputdata = u_c_hihi.0    
nres = 16 
ntask = 512 
```
